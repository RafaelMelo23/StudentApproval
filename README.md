This code was an exercise i did a while ago, but only got to publish it now. 
As i'm getting into Java more and more. The goal of the exercise is very simple but i think it was a good way to practice. The exercise is to print a student's informations, like his full name, enrollment number and his grades.
The only part of the code that was a tad bit more complex was the method to calculate the student's averages individually between the grades.
The way it works is, it takes the A1 grades, and A2, and calculates the averages between the elements of the arrays individually, going through a fori that goes through each a1 and a2 element one by one, like A1(first array element) * A2(first array element) / (a1 lenght).
I think this average system was a really good way to practice and improve my coding logic.
